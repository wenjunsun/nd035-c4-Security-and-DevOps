# Splunk log indexing results
- An example log file generated by my spring application can be found [here](https://github.com/wenjunsun/nd035-c4-Security-and-DevOps/blob/master/app.log)
- This log file is then indexed into Splunk. Then I used some queries to search for interesting patterns in my log data. Results are the following.

- Then, I created an alert so that when errors are logged in our app, an email will be sent to me. The search query used for the alert and the alert settings are shown below.

- Finally, I created some visualizations and dashboards in Splunk, as shown below.
